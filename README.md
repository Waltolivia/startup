[My Notes](notes.md)

I am going ot make a website that can be used to create stories and plan them. When writing you often uses many tabs for notes and some can be hard to connect. I want ot create a website that allows you to write, plan, and have many refrances and connections between topics so it is easier to plan, make notes, and other such activities wehre connections need to be made between topics.

> This is a template for your startup application. You must modify this `README.md` file for each phase of your development. You only need to fill in the section for each deliverable when that deliverable is submitted in Canvas. Without completing the section for a deliverable, the TA will not know what to look for when grading your submission. Feel free to add additional information to each deliverable description, but make sure you at least have the list of rubric items and a description of what you did for each item.

## 🚀 Specification Deliverable

> [!NOTE]
> Fill in this sections as the submission artifact for this deliverable. You can refer to this [example](https://github.com/webprogramming260/startup-example/blob/main/README.md) for inspiration.

For this deliverable I did the following. I checked the box `[x]` and added a description for things I completed.

- [X] Proper use of Markdown
- [X] A concise and compelling elevator pitch
- [X] Description of key features
- [X] Description of how you will use each technology
- [X] One or more rough sketches of your application. Images must be embedded in this file using Markdown image references.

### Elevator pitch

Writers and note takers often use many tools when creating. Some use paper to write down ideas as they can draw the connections, but they miss seeing the items all on one page. Computer users beneift from clear text, but miss a lot of the random colors and formatting of handwritten pages. I plan to make a website where you can have the clean clear writing of a computrer, and the ideas and connections of a notebook. A place where tabs can be taken, notes organized, but color coded, maped, connected and webbed to eachother. 


### Design

![Design image](placeholder.png)

I want to have three main pages. A Home page for introductions and sign in, a Notes page for main toics and file organization, and a Connections pageofr the visual connections and studying purposes. I want to have a tab at the top that holds all the pages and a notes tab on the side that holds the notes you are using or the informtion you have. One of my main goals is to have pages of notes pop up on the screen so many can be viewed at once like sticky notes. 


### Key features

- Note taking and saving ability
- A page to make a web and connect ideas
- Small screen pop ups of different tabs and/or topics

### Technologies

I am going to use the required technologies in the following ways.

- **HTML** - Basic website structure, like the skeleton
- **CSS** - What makes the site formatted and organized for the users feel/interaction
- **React** - Will help em in the layering of the tabs/topics that can appear
- **Service** - Will run the informtion from the backend/database to the front end or user
- **DB/Login** - Holds a users login and their past entries
- **WebSocket** - live update and connection, so live saving of the page. Multi-access to the same story?
